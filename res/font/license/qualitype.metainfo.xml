  <summary>45 fonts created by QualiType</summary>
  <description>
    <p>
      These 45 fonts were created by QualiType. With the kind permisison of 
      John Colletti, these fonts have been released as free and open-source. The
      fonts do not include small capitals, old-style figures or any other 
      OpenType goodies. They are released in part with future extension in mind. 
      The qualitype package will only carry the OpenType versions of the 
      original 1992 fonts; improvements should be given a new name and a 
      corresponding separate package.
