  <h1>The QualiType font collection</h1>
  <p>The fonts used in this site, specifically Eurotype, were released under SIL OFL 1.1 and GNU GPL 2.0. The fonts and licenses can be found under <a href="res/font/">res/font/</a>. Of particular note is the <a href="res/font/license/qualitype-doc.pdf">PDF</a> that describes their release under these licenses. I made special effort to document this because it took a long time to track these down (and I really like Eurotype).</p>
